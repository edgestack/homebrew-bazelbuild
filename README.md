# Brew Script for Bazel Build Tool
This script is for installing `Bazel Build Tool` into MacOS through brew. The motivation of this project is to install any version of `Bazel Build Tool` into MacOS. The offical brew repository only maintains the the latest version of `Bazel`, so that it is difficult to install specific version of `Bazel`.

## Usage
`$ brew tap sonaproject/bazelbuild`
`$ brew tap-pin sonaproject/bazelbuild`
`$ brew install bazel@VERSION`

VERSION needs to be replaced by the version of bazel that you would like to install.
